## Resources
* [slicknav](http://slicknav.io/)
    * I downloaded a jQuery plugin for navigation that switches between full screen and a mobile version. I had a lot of trouble getting it to work, but persevered and eventually was successful.
* [smoothscroll](http://www.dwuser.com/education/content/quick-guide-adding-smooth-scrolling-to-your-webpages/)
    * I downloaded a jQuery plugin for smooth scrolling.
* [parallax](http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/)
    * This is where I got the JQuery plugin for parallax scrolling. I've not done this before and it was really easy!
* [backstretch](http://www.jquery-backstretch.com/)
    * I used this jQuery plugin to create a slideshow in the Services section of my website. This one was also very easy to use.
* [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/)
    * I used this for help with jQuery commands.
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
    * I used this resource extensively, particularly for help with CSS effects such as having the text appear when mousing over images in the Events section.

## Deductions
"I reviewed the list of deductions for this assignment and in the syllabus."

## Comments
I wrote custom JavaScript code that adds text to the header that states whether the business is open or closed. I used getHours to get the current time, then changed the message depending on whether or not the current time falls within the hours the business is open.

I wrote custom jQuery to change the cursor to a pointer when hovering over headings in the Services section; and then to show hidden text when the headings are clicked on.

I also customized the css  and js files that came with the slicknav plugin so that the styles fit with my project.
